.TH CAP-AUDIT "8" "Jan 2026" "Red Hat" "System Administration Utilities"
.SH NAME
cap-audit \- discover the minimal capability set for a program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cap-audit
.RI [ options ]
.B --
.I command
.RI [ args ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcap-audit\fP traces a target process and its descendants to record every
kernel capability check it performs. The tool uses eBPF to hook capability
verification paths in the kernel and libcap-ng to format the results. Events
are filtered to only the traced process tree to reduce overhead.
.PP
The auditor fork/execs the requested command, registers its PID for tracing
before exec, and automatically tracks child PIDs. At the end of execution it
reports which capabilities were granted, which were attempted and denied, and
presents deployment snippets showing how to grant the minimal set.
.PP
Runtime tracing requires root or the CAP_BPF, CAP_PERFMON, and CAP_SYS_PTRACE capabilities, along with kernel BTF data in
\fI/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR -v , " --verbose"
Print each capability check as it occurs.
.TP
.BR -j , " --json"
Emit the analysis as JSON.
.TP
.BR -y , " --yaml"
Emit the analysis as YAML.
.TP
.BR --
End option parsing and treat the rest of the command line as the program to
execute under audit.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The program returns 0 on success. Non-zero values indicate an error occurred
while setting up tracing or executing the target command.
.SH NOTES
1. This utility observes the application behavior to decide what is needed. If you do not exercise all functionality, it can result in an incomplete inventory of needed capabilities. If it can't see it, cap-audit can't record it.

2. If you use Ctl-C to stop this program, be aware that the program it starts will continue running. If you want to stop both, send SIGTERM to the child process.
