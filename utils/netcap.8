.TH NETCAP: "8" "Feb 2026" "Red Hat" "System Administration Utilities"
.SH NAME
netcap \- a program to see capabilities
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B netcap
.RI [ --advanced
.RI [ --json ]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBnetcap\fP is a program that prints out a report of process capabilities.
By default, it runs in its historical filtered mode: if an application is
using tcp, udp, raw, or packet family sockets AND has any capabilities, it
will be in the report. If the process has partial capabilities, it is further
examined to see if it has an open-ended bounding set. If this is found to be
true, a '+' symbol is added. If the process has ambient capabilities, a '@'
symbol is added.

With \fB\-\-advanced\fP, \fBnetcap\fP switches to bind/listener inventory
mode for the current network namespace. In this mode, reachable binds/listeners
are reported regardless of whether the owning process has capabilities.

Some directories in the /proc file system are readonly by root. The program will try to access and report what it can. But if nothing comes out, try changing to the root user and re-run this program. 

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-advanced
Enable the posture/tree view. This mode inventories reachable binds in
the current network namespace and shows per-process capabilities, defenses,
and flags.
.TP
.B \-\-json
With \fB\-\-advanced\fP, emit machine-readable JSON instead of the tree
view.

.SH "ADVANCED MODE"
Advanced mode is an attack-surface and posture inventory for the current
network namespace. It is intended for administrators who need a structured
view of bind ownership and process hardening state.

The tree layout is:

.RS
Planes \-> interface \-> protocol \-> bind \-> port \-> process \->
caps/defenses/flags
.RE

Planes are grouped as INET (external), INET (loopback), VSOCK, and
LINK-LAYER. These names match the tree output exactly.

The console tree is a causal exposure chain: protocol, then bind address,
then port, then owning process. Wildcard binds are printed as \fB*\fP. Some
endpoints may appear under interface \fBmulticast/group\fP when bound to
multicast addresses that do not map to a single interface.

Under each protocol, \fBbind\fP nodes are socket bind addresses
(exposure), and \fBport\fP nodes are children of binds.

Socket selection is protocol-specific:
.IP \[bu] 2
TCP: LISTEN sockets only.
.IP \[bu] 2
UDP/UDPLITE: bound sockets.
.IP \[bu] 2
SCTP/DCCP: listener sockets only; established flows are not shown.
.IP \[bu] 2
VSOCK: stream LISTEN sockets, plus bound datagram/seqpacket sockets.
.IP \[bu] 2
RAW/PACKET: shown as binds; semantics differ from port listeners.

The defenses section is best-effort: \fBno_new_privs\fP and
\fBseccomp\fP mode are read from \fB/proc/<pid>/status\fP when
available, and the LSM label is read from
\fB/proc/<pid>/attr/current\fP when available. \fBsecurebits\fP and
their lock status are reported when available and meaningful
(typically for \fBuid==0\fP or non-default state), and may be
omitted otherwise. \fBruns_as_nonroot\fP is always reported.

Flags annotate notable conditions:
.IP \[bu] 2
\fBwildcard-bind\fP: bind is bound to a wildcard address
(for example 0.0.0.0 or ::).
.IP \[bu] 2
\fBloopback-only\fP: bind is reachable only via loopback scope.
.IP \[bu] 2
\fBhypervisor-plane\fP: bind is in the VSOCK communication plane.
.IP \[bu] 2
\fBssh-on-vsock-port-22\fP: VSOCK bind uses port 22.
.IP \[bu] 2
\fBprivileged-caps\fP: process has capabilities considered privileged for
attack-surface review.
.IP \[bu] 2
\fBsecurebits-locked\fP: securebits lock state is asserted for the process.

.SH "JSON OUTPUT"
When \fB\-\-advanced --json\fP is used, output contains:
.IP \[bu] 2
\fBschema_version\fP: top-level schema version.
.IP \[bu] 2
\fBplanes\fP: array of plane objects.

The console tree layout (human output) is:

.RS
planes \-> interface \-> protocol \-> bind \-> port \-> process
.RE

INET and LINK-LAYER JSON plane objects contain:

.RS
\fBifaces\fP \-> addrs \-> endpoints \-> processes
.RE

VSOCK JSON plane objects contain:

.RS
\fBendpoints\fP \-> processes
.RE

Fields under endpoints/processes/defenses may be omitted when unavailable.
When process defenses are present, they include \fBruns_as_nonroot\fP (yes
when uid != 0, no when uid == 0).

If a plane has no discovered binds, it appears with an empty list. If a
consumer does not receive a given plane, treat it as none found or omitted by
the producer.
